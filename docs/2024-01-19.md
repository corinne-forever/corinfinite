Testing running local models on MacBook
Device info:
- MacBook Pro 16 inch 2021
- Chip: Apple M1 Max
- Memory: 64 GB
- macOS Sonoma 14.2.1

LM Studio v0.2.10

Prompt: How do I implement a linked list in C?
Each prompt run from a new chat.
Each prompt was allowed to run to completion.
mlock: false
Only setting changed from defaults was "Use Apple Metal GPU"

Data taken from the summary provided by LM Studio at the end of inference.

| Model | Use Apple Metal GPU | time to first token | gen t | speed (tok/s) | gpu layers | cpu threads | token count |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf | true | 7.60s | 19.86s | 29.0 | 1 | 4 | 629/2048 |
| TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf | false | 4.17s | 85.73s | 10.0 | 0 | 4 | 941/2048 |
| TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-Chat-GGUF/llama-2-70b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf | true | 2.68s | 109.27s | 6.00 | 1 | 4 | 751/2048 |
| TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-Chat-GGUF/llama-2-70b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf | false | 51.70s | 242.31s | 2.00 | 0 | 4 | 591/2048 |

I'm not sure if the order of execution matters, but I ran these in order, except I ran without the GPU for llama before running with GPU (reverse the last two rows for temporal ordering).

some good counterpoints in the comments, but I like the post
