There are [existing](https://overmental.com/content/the-definitive-chronological-viewing-order-for-the-star-trek-cinematic-universe-42395) [resources](https://www.looper.com/389192/this-is-the-correct-order-in-which-to-watch-the-star-trek-franchise/) online provide some guidance on how to watch Star Trek in what I call "Universe Chronological Order", that is in the order that events happened in the Star Trek universe, not in the order the shows and movies were released. The contents here are almost entirely composed based on the two linked articles, plus some editing of my own. This is mostly the order I have watched Star Trek in, except for Discovery, Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds.

This order may or may not be for everyone. For example while watching Enterprise with a friend there was a VERY heavy handed reference to the Prime Directive that totally went over my head until my friend started laughing and said "wow that was very heavy handed" and explained why. Enterprise may also be a rather rough first Trek to go through, I am glad I got it out of the way first, but others may find it too painful to watch. The finale of Enterprise (These Are The Voyages) also may not make a lot of sense (who is this fancy new crew?) without prior exposure to TNG. When I saw it my exposure had almost entirely come from memes, so I had a vague familiarity with the TNG characters already.

First timers may not enjoy this order, instead opting for something closer to release order or picking shows that you enjoy. This order may be great for folks who already are quite familiar with Star Trek. 

# Original Timeline
#### **Star Trek: Enterprise**
TODO: maybe put finale into TNG timeline. It will probably make more sense to have it in both places (i.e. duplicated). ENT is sufficiently far apart from TNG that it would not feel repetitive to have it in both places.
#### **The Cage**
#### **Star Trek: Discovery (Seasons 1-2)**
#### **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds**
#### **Star Trek: The Original Series**
As a modern viewer I struggled a lot with watching this in its entirety and ended up skipping several episodes and only watching a list of episodes that would be essential for lore.
#### **Star Trek: The Animated Series**
#### **Star Trek: The Motion Picture**
#### **Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan**
#### **Star Trek III: The Search For Spock**
#### **Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home**
#### **Star Trek V: The Final Frontier**
#### **Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country**
#### Star Trek: The Next Generation (Seasons 1-6)
#### Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 1)
While TNG S6 and DS9 S1 occur at roughly the same time, there is important background for DS9 presented in TNG S6 in Chain of Command (Parts 1 and 2) along with Descent Part 1, so I think it is preferable to finish S6 before moving on to DS9.
#### **Star: Trek The Next Generation (Season 7) / Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 2**)
These two seasons also take place at roughly the same time, though it’s worth noting that _The Next Generation_ Season 7 ends just before the last few episodes of _Deep Space Nine_ Season 2.

> But most importantly, \[TNG S7\] ties into and reinforces "Deep Space Nine," most notably in the penultimate episode "Preemptive Strike," (S7 E24) which deals with concurrent "DS9" problems like the Cardassians and the Maquis. https://www.looper.com/389192/this-is-the-correct-order-in-which-to-watch-the-star-trek-franchise/
#### **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 3, Episodes “The Search: Part 1” – “Distant Voices”) / Star Trek: Voyager Season 1 (Episodes “Caretaker” – “Prime Factors”)**
#### **Star Trek: Generations**
TODO: why is this put here instead of in between seasons?
#### **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 3, Episodes “Through The Looking Glass” – “The Adversary”) / Star Trek: Voyager (Season 1, Episodes “State of Flux” – “Learning Curve”)**
> Due to this premise, there's no reason whatsoever to jump between individual episodes of these two seasons, as the events of one show don't affect the other in any way. But jumping between shows by the season provides a fun and accurate experience of what it was like to watch the interlocking "Star Trek" programs of the 1990s. https://www.looper.com/389192/this-is-the-correct-order-in-which-to-watch-the-star-trek-franchise/
#### **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 4) / Star Trek: Voyager (Season 2**)

#### **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 5, Episodes “Apocalypse Rising” – “For The Uniform”) / Star Trek: Voyager (Season 3, “Basics: Part 2” – “Blood Fever”)**
#### **Star Trek: First Contact**
#### **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 5, Episodes “In Purgatory’s Shadow” – “A Call To Arms”) / Star Trek: Voyager (Season 3, “Unity” – “Scorpion: Part 1”)**
#### **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 6) / Star Trek: Voyager (Season 4**)
#### **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 7, “Image In The Sand” – “Covenant”) / Star Trek: Voyager (Season 5, “Night”  – “Infinite Regress”)**

#### **Star Trek: Insurrection**

#### **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 7, “It’s Only A Paper Moon” – “What You Leave Behind”) / Star Trek: Voyager (Season 5, “Nothing Human”  – “Equinox: Part 1”)**
#### **Star Trek: Voyager (Season 6-7)**
#### **Star Trek: Nemesis**
#### **Star Trek: Lower Decks**

#### **Star Trek (2009)**
> The J.J. Abrams helmed _Star Trek_ kicks off the “reboot” era known as the “Kelvin Timeline,” after the USS Kelvin. While most of the story takes place in an alternate timeline (which we’ll explore in a separate section below), events narrated by Spock take place in the original continuity, following the destruction of Romulus.
>
>The aftermath of this event in the original timeline is explored in the series, _Picard_. https://overmental.com/content/the-definitive-chronological-viewing-order-for-the-star-trek-cinematic-universe-42395
#### **Short Treks: Children of Mars**
#### **Star Trek: Picard**
#### **Short Treks: Calypso**
#### **Star Trek: Discovery (Season 3)**
and probably season 4

# Kelvin Timeline
The Kelvin timeline branches off beginning with Star Trek (2009), see above.
#### **Star Trek** (2009)
#### Star Trek Into Darkness
#### Star Trek Beyond

# Additional edits
- Time travel episodes could be put into where they travel to. For example the Lower Decks and SNW crossover. I expect it would make sense to put them in both places.
- It would be beneficial to note for items listed at the same time (e.g. the entry `Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 3, Episodes “The Search: Part 1” – “Distant Voices”) / Star Trek: Voyager Season 1 (Episodes “Caretaker” – “Prime Factors”)`) what the watch order between the two is, if it matters, or if they are effectively simultaneous.
- Review existing TODOs in the list
